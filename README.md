    conn.query("CREATE NODE TABLE City(name STRING, population INT64, PRIMARY KEY (name))")
    conn.query("CREATE REL TABLE Follows(FROM User TO User, since INT64)")
    conn.query("CREATE REL TABLE LivesIn(FROM User TO City)")

    # Load data.
    conn.query("COPY User FROM \"user.csv\"")
    conn.query("COPY City FROM \"city.csv\"")
    conn.query("COPY Follows FROM \"follows.csv\"")
    conn.query("COPY LivesIn FROM \"lives-in.csv\"")

    # Execute a simple query.
    result = conn.query("MATCH (a:User)-[f:Follows]->(b:User) RETURN a.name, f.since, b.name;")

    # Output query result.
    result.each do |tuple|
        name, since, name2 = tuple.values_at( :a_name, :f_since, :b_name )
